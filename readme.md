# Sepia Contrasted Theme for VSCode (lightness & accessibility)

Colour theme for Visual Studio Code with a light background colour (beige, not harmful white!) and contrasted foreground colours to ensure accessibility (a11y) and readability.

This theme is originally based on the “Solarized Light Theme” but improved to have text contrast on background with a ratio of at least 4.5:1 (as recommended in the WCAG level AA accessibility rules).

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress. I still don’t have test each colour in the theme because I don’t know how to see each of them at the moment.

Colours may change in the future.
