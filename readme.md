# Sepia Contrasted Theme for VSCode (lightness & accessibility)

Colour theme for Visual Studio Code with a light background colour (beige, not harmful white!) and contrasted foreground colours to ensure accessibility (a11y) and readability.

This theme is originally based on the “Solarized Light Theme” but improved to have text contrast on background with a ratio of at least 4.5:1 (as recommended in the WCAG level AA accessibility rules). But I've finally changed some colours. ;-)

## :warning: Work in progress

This is a work in progress. I still don’t have test each colour in the theme because I don’t know how to see each of them at the moment.

Colours may change in the future.

## How to use

This theme is not yet submitted to the Visual Studio Code marketplace but you can use it by copying the theme folder into the extensions folder of VS Code.

In Windows, it's hidden in `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\extensions`.
